# INET 4031 Geometry App

## Program Description
This geometry app utilizes Flask, Python, and HTML to create a web interface for calculating the volume of cylinders and spheres. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how Python and Flask work together to build a simple, interactive geometry calculator.

## Operation

You can run this repository in two different ways:

### 1. Running the Python Files Directly
Each shape includes a calculation script and a corresponding test file:

- cylinder.py and cylindertest.py
- sphere.py and spheretest.py

Running these files will execute the geometry logic and automated unit tests.

### 2. Running the Web Application Using Flask
The HTML files can be hosted using a Flask environment.  
This project was developed using a .venv virtual environment with Flask installed.

To run the Flask app:

```bash
flask --app hello run
